# Conway's Game of Life
The Game of Life is a celluar automation where its evolution is determined by its initial state without any further input

## Game of Life Rules
This game is played on a two-dimensional grid, where each square is a cell and has only two possibles states - live or dead.
The rules are iteratively applied to create future generations. For each generation of the game, a cell's status in the next generation is determined by a set of rules. These simple rules are as follows:

- If the cell is alive, then it stays alive if it has either 2 or 3 live neighbors
- If the cell is dead, then it springs to life only in the case that it has 3 live neighbors

## Setup
This project is based on [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvVt11mPuM0) and it makes few changes to it. This is done entirely in react so to get started

```bash
npx creat-react-app game-of-life --typescript
```
